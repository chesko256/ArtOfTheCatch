	* You can use Art of the Catch for personal use.

	* You can't copy and distribute it on other websites or include it in a package.

	* You can make translations of Art of the Catch, and you don't have to ask for permission; you already have permission. You can't translate and redistribute the entire mod; you can only create and distribute a Art of the Catch.esp-dependent plug-in and translate the message forms in the plug-in. You can also translate and distribute the ArtoftheCatch_<LANGUAGE>.txt files used by SkyUI's Mod Configuration Menu.

	* You can create Art of the Catch-dependent mods and distribute them for free. You don't need permission to do this; you already have permission. As above, you can't redistribute the entire mod with your mod. If your Art of the Catch-dependent mod is paid, contact me at chesko.tesmod@gmail.com for details.
	
	* If you have a question, just contact me at chesko.tesmod@gmail.com or the contact information at the bottom of the agreement.
